# holosim-ml ðŸ“¡
```holosim-ml``` is a library for beam simulation and analysis of radio holography data from complex optical systems. This code uses machine learning to efficiently determine the position of hundreds of mirror adjusters on multiple mirrors with few micron accuracy. We apply this approach to the example of the Simons Observatory 6 m telescope.

## Dependencies
* Python>=3.6
* numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/orgs/McMahonCosmologyGroup/holosim-ml
```

The notebooks call two .csv files with the telescope mirrors' panel geometries.  In order to run the notebooks, change the path in ```pan_mod.py``` to the location of the .csv files (lines 264 and 270). 
```
# Primary mirror adjuster positions
df_m1 = pd.read_csv(
    "path/to/folder/pans-adjs/Mirror-M1-vertical-adjuster-points_r1-1.csv",
    skiprows=2,
    na_values=["<-- ", "--> ", "<--", "-->"],
)
# Secondary mirror adjuster positions
df_m2 = pd.read_csv(
    "path/to/folder/pans-adjs/Mirror-M2-vertical-adjuster-points_r1-1.csv",
    skiprows=2,
    na_values=["<-- ", "--> ", "<--", "-->"],
)
```
